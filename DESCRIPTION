Description: Identifies the optimal transformation of a surrogate marker and estimates the proportion of treatment explained (PTE) by the optimally-transformed surrogate at an earlier time point when the primary outcome of interest is a censored time-to-event outcome; details are described in Wang et al (2021) <doi:10.1002/sim.9185>.
